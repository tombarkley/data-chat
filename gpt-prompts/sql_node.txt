// this is for a node.js file that is called from the server.js file
// this file sends a sql query to the database and returns the results to the server.js file 
// the database is a sql server database
// the sql statement will vary depending on the user's input and is generated in the gpt.js file
// the sql statement is first sent to the front end from the server.js file and then approved by the user and then sent to this file through the server.js file
// the sql statement is then sent to the database and the results are returned to the server.js file in a json object with the following keys:
//  i. headers - an array of headers for the table
//  ii. rows - an array of rows for the table
// the headers and rows will be used to create a table on the front end
