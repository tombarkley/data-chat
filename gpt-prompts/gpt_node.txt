// this is for a node.js file that is called from the server.js file
// this file leverages the openai api to analyze and respond to user input
// this file will have a following data:
//  chat_types - an array of chat bot styles that will contain objects that contain the following data:
//    1. name - the name of the chat bot style that will correspond to the chat_style in the user input object
//    2. prompt - the prompt that will be prepended to the chat_entry in the user input object to get a response from the openai api
//  chat_response - an object that will be returned to the server.js file and will contain the following data:
//    1. semantics - the response from the openai api that is retrieved in the getSemantics function
//    2. bot - the response from the openai api that is retrieved in the getResponse function
//    3. data - the response from the openai api that is retrieved in the getQuery function
//    4. chat_style - the chat bot style that was used to get the response from the openai api
//    5. chat_prompt - the prompt that was used to get the response from the openai api
//  openai_api_key - the api key for the openai api. this is stored in a .env file at the root of the project
// it will receive the user input in an object that contains the following:
//  1. the user input (chat_entry)
//  2. a chat bot style (chat_style)
// there are several main functions that this does:
//  gptIn - receive the input from the server.js file and route it through steps
//  getSemantics - send user input to the openai api to get determine if the user input was a response to a chat bot or a request for data. it should save to the chat_response object under the semantics key
//  getQuery - send the user input to the openai api to get a query that can be used to get data from the database. it should save to the chat_response object under the data key
//  getResponse - send the user input to the openai api to get a chat bot response with a style (the chat_prompt key in the chat_response object) that matches the chat_style in the user input object. thre openai response should save to the chat_response object under the bot key
// when the user input is received through the gptIn function, it will:
//  1. clear out the values in the chat_response object
//  2. loop through the chat_types array to find the chat bot style that matches the chat_style in the user input object and save that to the chat_prompt key in the chat_response object
//  2. be sent to the getSemantics function to determine if the user input is a response to a chat bot or a request for data
//   2.1 if the user input is a response to a chat bot, it will be sent to the getResponse function to get a chat bot response
//   2.2 if the user input is a request for data it will do the following:
//    2.2.1 send the user input to the getResponse function to get a chat bot response
//    2.2.2 send the user input to the getQuery function to get a query that can be used to get data from the database
//   2.2 (continued) it should do both of the substeps above in parallel
//  3. send the chat_response object to the server.js file
// I will define the chat_types variable later in the file, for now it can just be declared as an empty array
